/**
 * The component interface <code>ParentNotificationCI</code> declares the
 * methods used by child models to notify their parent models about their
 * processing of external events at each simulation step.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This component interface is based on the corresponding Java interface
 * <code>ParentNotificationI</code> defined by the DEVS simulation library
 * to declare the methods used by coordination engines to implement the DEVS
 * simulation protocol and some other library-dependent associated methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This component interface is not made extending (in the Java sense) the
 * corresponding Java interface first because RMI forces to add exceptions
 * thrown by the RMI protocol.
